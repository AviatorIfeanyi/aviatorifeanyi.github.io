								</a>
								<p> Earthquakes are a common natural disaster that can occur anywhere in the world. 
									Caused by the movement of tectonic plates in the Earth's crust, which can result in the 
									release of huge amounts of energy in the form of seismic waves. Earthquakes can range 
									in intensity from minor tremors that are barely noticeable to major disasters that can 
									cause widespread destruction and loss of life. 
									Over the past 70 years, earthquakes have occurred in many different parts of the world, some with more 
									frequency and intensity than others. <br> <br>
									In this analysis, we will look at the occurrence of earthquakes around the world from 1950 to 2022, 
									including the most significant earthquakes that have occurred during this time period and the regions that 
									are most at risk for earthquakes.
									
									<br /> <br />Tools Used: Python, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Pandas, Jupyter Notebook

									the September 11th attacks in the United States, the London bombings in 2005, the Mumbai attacks in 2008, 
									and the Paris attacks in 2015. These attacks have had a significant impact on the countries and
